# Hardware-Implementation-of-NOMA-Using-Modified-Residual-CNN-on-FPGA
NOMA system in Verilog, focusing on modulation classification using CNN models
Developed a digital VLSI architecture and FPGA implementation of a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access
(NOMA) system using a Modified Residual-CNN.
This project addresses the challenges in future 6G networks, aiming to improve spectral efficiency, data
rates, and energy efficiency.
The proposed solution automates modulation classification (AMC) in NOMA systems, allowing for real-
time AMC hardware implementation, reducing system overhead, and enhancing performance through
successive interference cancellation (SIC).
This work demonstrates a novel hardware approach to a traditionally software-dominated field.
